===== DAYTIME =====

1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames.

1	192.168.64.4	132.163.97.1	TCP	[SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=1239527902 TSecr=0 WS=128
2	132.163.97.1	192.168.64.4	TCP	[SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1382 WS=64 SACK PERM
3	192.168.64.4	132.163.97.1	TCP	[ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64256 Len=0


2. What port number does the client use for this interaction?

The client uses port 45892 for this interaction.


3. Why does the client need a port?

The client needs a port in order to target which specific software it speaking with and to map the trajectory of requests.


4. What frame contains the actual date and time?

4	132.163.97.1	192.168.64.4	DAYTIME 	DAYTIME Response


5. What is the full content (not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers) of the frame? What do each of the pieces of the frame content represent?

The full content is the ASCII representation of the date time information received from the server. Each piece of the frame content represents an encrypted byte comprising the ASCII string.


6. What does [SYN] mean?

[SYN] is a synchronization packet, containing a sequence number and determining which ports communication should take place over and establishing that communication will take place.


7. What does [ACK] mean?

[ACK] is an acknowledgement packet, agreeing to a [SYN] packet that communication will take place in a certain direction or with a [FIN] packet that communication will end.


8. What does [FIN] mean?

[FIN] indicates that communication will end and the connection should be closed.


9. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?

The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection. I can tell this because the server IP was the first to send a [FIN] packet.

===== HTTP =====

1. How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?

There were two TCP connections opened. I can tell because there were two [SYN] packets sent by the client and two received but the server.


2. Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested?

Your homepage was requested on frame 7. I can tell because this is where an HTTP request was sent by the client with the info reading:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1.


3. Can you tell where my photograph (jeff_square_head.jpg) was requested?

Your photograph was requested on frame 11. I can tell because this is where an HTTP request was sent by the nc client with the info reading:
GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1.


===== QUESTIONS =====

I am a little hazy on the terminology for what a connection counts as. Am I correct in thinking one connection is formed by both the client and the server sending each other [SYN] packets?

Why is the nc client not just called the client, what is the difference?
